This file is used only for the "Dictionary" feature of the Extra Window extension.
It uses a custom format specific to Textractor and is not meant to be written manually.
You should look for a dictionary in this format online (https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor-Dictionaries/releases is a good place to start).
Alternatively, if you're a programmer, you can write a script to convert a dictionary from another format with the info below.
Once you have a dictionary, to look up some text in Extra Window, select it. All matching definitions will be shown.
Definitions are formatted like this:|TERM|Hola|TERM|hola|TERM|Bonjour|TERM|bonjour|DEFINITION|hello|END|
The definition can include rich text (https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/richtext-html-subset.html) which will be formatted properly.
All text in this file outside of a definition is ignored.
Terms longer than 50 characters may not be shown (for performance reasons that should be fixed soon).
This file must be encoded in UTF-8.
